# Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss and brain atrophy, leading to cognitive decline and memory impairment. Early detection of AD is crucial for initiating timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including VGG16, AlexNet, and MobileNet, to detect AD at an early stage.

## Importance of Early Detection
Early detection enables the development of more efficient treatments, potentially delaying disease progression and extending patients' lives. ML serves as a valuable tool in identifying AD, offering the potential for accurate predictions and improved diagnostic capabilities.

## Challenges and Methodology
Challenges in evaluating ML approaches for AD detection include diverse datasets, feature selection, and class imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a methodology involving pre-processing, attribute selection, and classification using association rule mining. This approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy and facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of ML models.

## Utilized Models
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16)
- AlexNet
- MobileNet

## Future Directions
By applying advanced deep learning techniques and refining evaluation methodologies, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of AD detection. Our goal is to contribute to better diagnoses and treatment outcomes for individuals affected by AD.
